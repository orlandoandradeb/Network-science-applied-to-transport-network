# Network science applied to public transport networks

The code presented in this repository aims to analyze the structural features of the public transport network. Specifically, it analyzes 3 main aspects of the transit system which are: accessibility which indicates the travel time efficiency that the network can bring derived mainly from the geometry of the lines, headway, commercial speed, and connectivity among lines.  The second component is the spatial friction which indicates the efficiency of the trips in terms of distance. Finally, the vulnerability denotes the ease where the network can be affected in its performance by affectation in its structure. In this case, a set of structural indicators were taken such as average path length, spectral gap, and the central point dominance.

This code was used to generate the following paper: 




Which in the end is a very pragmatic approach to analyze public transport networks in terms of efficiency of travel time, spatial friction, and vulnerability.
